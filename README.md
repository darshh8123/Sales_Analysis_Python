# Product Sales Analysis Using Python
This project analyzes product sales data using Python to uncover key trends, optimize inventory, and boost revenue. The analysis focuses on a 12-month sales dataset to provide actionable business insights.

## Key Insights
Best-selling products and peak sales months were identified for revenue optimization.

Profitability was analyzed by comparing revenue and cost for each product.

Sales trends were examined by customer demographics (age groups) and geography (countries).

## Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Environment (Google Colab)

## Comprehensive Product Sales Analysis
This project is a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a product sales dataset. The primary goal is to leverage data-driven insights to optimize business strategies, including inventory management, marketing campaigns, and revenue forecasting. The analysis was conducted entirely in a Google Colab environment, ensuring full reproducibility.

## Methodology & Key Analyses
This project follows a standard data science workflow, from data cleaning to advanced analysis. The core steps and key insights include:

Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, corrected data types, and prepared the dataset for analysis.

Revenue Trends: Identified overall revenue trends, highlighting peak sales months and potential seasonality.

Product Performance: Analyzed sales volume and profitability to determine best-selling and most profitable products.

Geographic & Demographic Analysis: Examined sales performance across different countries and customer age groups to pinpoint key markets and consumer segments.
